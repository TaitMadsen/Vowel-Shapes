The Modes

Mentor Mode
Records an audio input, and displays it on the screen.  Does not
compare the input to a baseline.  The input can be saved to a
location selected by the user.  This mode is intended for creating
baseline vowels for others to strive to match.

Study Mode
Displays a baseline vowel and allows the user to listen to it.
In this mode, the application will not accept audio input.

Practice Mode
Accepts audio input from the user, converts the audio to a vowel 
visualization and places the visualization over the user selected 
baseline vowel visualization. Practice mode will have an option 
to record.

Review Mode
Allows the user to replay a previously recorded practice-session 
vowel recording with the visualization from the practice session 
and a selected baseline vowel.
