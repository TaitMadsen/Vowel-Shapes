The challenge of learning new vowel sounds in the context of vocal
music has long been addressed by careful listening and mimicking
sound. We propose to open another option, visual learning. Vowel 
shapes is a computer application written in Python to run on both
Macintosh and Windows computers, intended for (but not limited to)
use by students and teachers of vocal music. The application will
utilize the computer's microphone or one that is externally linked. 
Using input from the microphone while the user vocalizes, the
application will create a real-time visual representation of the vowel 
being produced. This representation will be a graph, oval, or triangle 
as the user prefers. The real power of this application comes in its 
ability to save previously produced vowels, so the user may listen to
and view them as the he or she attempts to replicate. This enables 
teachers and the community to set exacting benchmarks for students to 
achieve and master.
